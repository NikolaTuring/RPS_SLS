# ⚠️ RPS V0.1 – Experimental SLS 3D Printer (WIP)

> **⚠️ WARNING: This project is a work in progress!**
>
> **PLEASE DO NOT attempt to build this printer yet!**

## 🧪 About

**RPS V0.1** (Resolve-Print-Systems) is an experimental open-source Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printer developed for research and educational purposes.  
The goal is to create a powerful, modular SLS platform — but the project is still in early development stages.

> 🚧 Use at your own risk. This project involves dangerous hardware and is not intended for beginners.

## 🧯 Safety First

> **LASER CLASS 4 + SLS POWDER = EXTREME DANGER**

- Always wear appropriate **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**.
- Never operate the machine without protective housing, eye protection, and a proper exhaust system.
- SLS powder is hazardous and must be handled in a well-controlled environment.

## ⚙️ Material Recommendations

Structural and functional components should be printed in **PA6-GF** or higher-performance materials such as **PPS-CF**.  
Do **not** use low-temperature or brittle filaments like PLA — they are unsafe and will fail under SLS conditions.

## 🔌 Laser & PWM Control

The laser is controlled via one of the **fan output pins** using **PWM**.  
It is automatically initialized when the mainboard boots into **Mainsail**.

Always confirm your firmware configuration and test safety interlocks before powering on the laser!
